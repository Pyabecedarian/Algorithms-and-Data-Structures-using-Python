Priority Queue

In Stage1, we have learned about the FIFO data structure `queue`. A `priority queue` acts like a queue,
however, in a priority queue the logical order of items inside a queue is determined by its priority.

It's easy to implement a priority queue using sorting algorithms, but remember that inserting into a list
is O(n) and sorting a list is O(n log n). There is a better way to do this.

`Binary Heap` is a key to this problem. A priority queue implemented by a binary heap can allow us
enqueue/dequeue in O(log n) time.

If we diagram the heap, it looks like a binary tree, but we implement it only use a single list.
There are two variations: `Min Heap` and `Max Heap`. The min heap always keep the smallest item
in front, while the max heap keeps the largest as priority.


Structure Property
    In order to guarantee the logarithmic performance, we must keep our tree balanced, that is, a binary tree
    almost has the same number of nodes in the left and right subtrees, except for the leave nodes. The tree
    like this also called a `complete binary tree`:
                                            5
                                        7       9
                                     16  17  10  21     --->   [0, 5, 7, 9, 16, 17, 10, 21, 19, 18]
                                   19  18                    a `0` here just for simple integer division
    ※IMPORTANT※
        > a complete tree can be represented by a single list, in which any left child of a parent (at position p)
        is the node that is found in position `2p` in the list. Similarly the right child is at `2p+1`.

        > reversely, to find the parent of any node in the tree, we can simply use integer division (`//`), for a
        node at position `x` in a tree, its parent is at `x//2`.

Order Property
    In a heap, for every node x with parent p, the (root) value in p is <= value in x


Possible methods of a Binary Heap:
    > BinaryHeap()   :  constructor
    > enqueue(item)  :  add a new item to the heap
    > min()          :  returns the item with the minimum value
    > dequeue()      :  returns the item with the minimum value, removing the item from the heap
    > buildHeap(list):  builds a new heap from a list of values
