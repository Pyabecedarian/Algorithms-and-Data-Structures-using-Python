* Task: Merge k sorted list using priority queue *

Analysis:
    The easies way is creating a n*k sized list and sort. The best sorting algorithm will be in O(nk log nk) time.
    If make use of the priority queue, We can do better in O(nk log k).

    Steps:
        0. Create a empty list;
        1. Create a Min Heap, push the 1st elements in each list, the minimum value must be on top of the heap;
        2. Pop the top and push the next element from which list the pop operation has just performed;
        3. Repeat the steps until all element in k lists are consumed.
