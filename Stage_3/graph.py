Graph


Important Definitions
    Vertex
        is a `node` in graph

    Edge
        connects two vertices to show that there is a relationship between them. The edges may be one-way or
        two way. If the edges in graph are all one-way, the graph is a `direct graph` or a `digraph`.
        A edge can be represented by a tuple, (fromVertex, toVertex, weight).

    Weight
        is the cost to go from one vertex to another.

    Path
        is a sequence of vertices that are connected by edges.

    Cycle
        is a path in a digraph that starts and ends at the same vertex. A graph with no cycle is called `acyclic
        graph`.
        A digraph with no cycle is call `direct acyclic graph`, or `DAG`


Implementation Details
    There are two several ways can implement the `Graph` abstract data structure, the adjacency matrix and the
    adjacency list. The second is a space-efficient way to implement a sparsely connected graph.

    The adjacency list implementation keeps a master list of all the vertices in the Graph object, and
    each Vertex object in the graph maintains a list of the other vertices that it is connected to.

    Thr Vertex class uses a dictionary to keep track of the vertices to which it is connected, and the weight
    of each edge.
    The Graph class uses a dictionary that maps vertex keys to vertex objects.

        class Vertex
            self.key
            self.connected = { V0: w0, V1: w1, ... }
                                ↓
                              Vertex()

        class Graph:
            self.vertices_list = { k0: V0, k1: V1, ... }

                k0    :     V0          k1     :     V1...
                 ↓           ↓
            vert key     Vertex()

Possible methods of Graph() are as follows:
    > Graph()                           : constructor
    > addVertex(vert)                   : adds an instance of `Vertex` to the graph
    > addEdge(fromVert, toVert)         : adds a edge that connects two vertices
    > addEdge(fromVert, toVert, weight) : adds a new weighted edge
    > getVertex(vertKey)                : finds the vertex in the graph named by `vertKey`
    > in   statement
