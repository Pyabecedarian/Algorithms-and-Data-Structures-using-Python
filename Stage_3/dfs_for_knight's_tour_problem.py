Problem Solving: the Knight's Tour Problem
    The knight's tour puzzle is played on a chess board with a single chess piece, the knight. The object of the puzzle
    is to find a sequence of moves that allow the knight to visit every square on the board exactly once.

    Solution:
        > Represent the legal moves of a knight on a chessboard as a graph
        > Use a graph algorithm to find a path of length `rows*columns - 1` where every vertex on the graph is visited
          exactly once.

    Details:
        1. Build the knight's tour graph (see the code in `build_knight_tour_graph`).

                     _     *1*       _      *3*      _              Vertex 12 should connect:

                    *5*      _       _       _      *9*               [ 5, 15, 1, 21, 3, 23, 9, 19 ]

                     _       _    *12*       _       _

                   *15*      _       _       _     *19*

                     _     *21*      _     *23*      _

        Start at vertex 12, a knight can moves to 8 places, each of them can represented by a couple of offsets
        to the original vertex. The offset of row/column can be [-2, -1, 1, 2]. Then we can calculate the
        tour vertex by the formula:
                            tour_vertex = new_row * board_size + new_col

        2. The search algorithm for this problem to find a path that has exactly 63 edges is DFS, which creates
           a search tree by exploring one branch of the tree as deeply as possible. Whereas the BFS builds a
           search tree one level at a time.

           DFS uses a Stack to backtracking, since dfs is recursive.

        3. Speed up the algorithm with heuristics by choose the next connected vertex of currVert to a vertex has
           the smallest connected vertices list.
